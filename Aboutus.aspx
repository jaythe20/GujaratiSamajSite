		About Us</p>
		<p >Gujarati Samaj of Montreal Inc 
		is a non-profit community-based organization totally dedicated to the 
		advancement of Gujarati culture, religions, folklore, history, and 
		philosophy. Set up formally in September 1976, The Gujarati Samaj - 
		Montreal Inc undertakes to enhance and foster the Gujarati heritage in 
		Quebec.</p>
		<p>At the time of its inception 
		the objectives of the organization were to provide for the social and 
		cultural needs of the Gujarati speaking people of the province of Quebec 
		and to foster understanding and co-operation with other cultural bodies 
		forming the Canadian mosaic. Since its inception the Samaj has been able 
		to uphold its objectives through its activities. A good deal of our rich 
		heritage and culture has been passed on to the Gujarati youth born and 
		brought up in Quebec. </p>
		<p>New initiatives recognize the 
		long-standing generational growth of the Gujarati community in Quebec, 
		and thus serve to foster cross-cultural appreciation and understanding 
		through joint projects with sister associations across Quebec. Working 
		together, we promote cultural understanding with other communities in 
		the Canadian Society, and assist and cooperate with other organizations 
		across Canada that have similar objectives to our organization.</p>
		<p>The Gujarati-speaking community 
		in Montreal has a distinct and diverse history. Its members have a 
		common ancestral tie in that they are a people whose origins come from 
		the state of Gujarat in India. Our members, however, are quite a diverse 
		mix - with those coming from India direct, those that have transplanted 
		themselves to Africa or the Caribbean or other parts of Asia before 
		coming to Canada, and those that may have made several stops through a 
		few generations from India to Africa to Europe and then to Canada! And 
		now, of course, we have a budding 2nd and 3rd generation that were born 
		and educated and raised here! Religions are diverse too - Hinduism is 
		predominant, but there are Jains, Muslims, Catholics and even on 
		occasion those of the Jewish faith! It is a true testament to the 
		diversity of India!</p>
		<p>We are primarily a Montreal 
		based organisation - and our members are those who have an affinity or 
		interest in the Gujarati cultures and traditions. As such, our members - 
		while typically of Gujarati origin - also include those who come from 
		other regions of India, Canada and so forth. Non-Gujarati speaking 
		members will usually join our group through affiliation with friends 
		and/or through marriage, thereby increasing the diversity in our 
		membership.</p>
		<p>Our activities also reflect the 
		diverse nature of our membership. We have undertaken to offer a wide 
		variety of mixed cultural activities... ski trips, picnics, 
		cabane-a-sucre, Holi celebrations, cross country exchanges with other 
		groups, business mentoring programs for the youth, bazaars and fun 
		fairs, our Diwali festivities, Christmas and so much more! … Talk about 
		a melding of cultures!!</p>
